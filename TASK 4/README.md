Task 4 : Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The application allows a user to play against the computer by choosing between rock, paper or scissors. The computer randomly selects its move and the game determines the winner using standard rules:
Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cut Paper
Paper covers Rock

Key Features:
- Interactive user input with prompt-based choice selection
- Randomized computer choices to simulate real gameplay
- Clear game logic to determine the outcome of each round
- Displays both user and computer choices with result (Win/Lose/Tie)
- Optional score tracking for both user and computer across multiple rounds
- Replay functionality to allow continuous play
- Simple and intuitive user interface with helpful feedback and instructions

This project demonstrates the use of conditional logic, random number generation, loops, and basic user interface design in Python. Ideal for beginners exploring Python game development.
