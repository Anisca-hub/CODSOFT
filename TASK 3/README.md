Task 3 : Password Generator
This project is a Python-based Password Generator that helps users create strong and secure passwords. The application allows users to define the desired password length and automatically generates a password using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to ensure complexity and security. It is a handy tool for enhancing account safety by avoiding weak or predictable passwords.

Key Features:
- User input for specifying password length
- Randomized character selection for robust password generation
- Instant display of the generated password

This project showcases fundamental Python skills, including user input handling, randomization, and string manipulationâ€”making it a practical and educational utility script.
